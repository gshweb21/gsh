										<h2 class="major">REBAR</h2>
										<p>REBAR is a strengthening product that really helps the plant build stronger cell walls. The silicone liquid solution gets absorbed and acts like rebar for the plant by strengthening the stems. Silicon also has many other benefits like enhancing growth/yield, drought stress, resistance to bacterial and fungal diseases and much more. The bottom line is your plants cannot sustain big, fat heavy buds without strong stems to support them. This product is exactly what you need.</p>

										<h2 class="major">BEST BUDS</h2>
										<p>Best Buds is a blend of Phosphorous, Potassium and Sulfur that gives your plants the right amount of nutrients to build sweet, sticky, and smelly BUDS! Every grower wants the best buds and this product will help you get there. These 3 nutrients are called MACRO NUTRIENTS because the plant uses a LOT of them throughout the growing season. In the reproductive part of your grow, your plants need plenty of these 3 nutrients to be able to reach their potential and really put on weight. Don’t waste 3 months of your life just to get average (or most of the time below average results). Make the commitment to do better and be the envy of all your friends!</p>

										<h2 class="major">GROW MICRO BLOOM</h2>
										<p>GROW, MICRO & BLOOM are all base nutrients that are used every week throughout the entire grow. These products provide the plants with all the nutrients they need for basic plant growth. Gold Standard Hydroponics has developed a line of liquid fertilizers that are specially designed for Cannabis plants that will help you achieve the kind of heavy yields every grower dreams of.</p>

								<div class="content">
									<h2 class="major">FLOWER POWER</h2>
									<p>FLOWER POWER, as the name suggests, is for the flowering part of your grow. It helps the flowering process by providing the plant with two forms of Potassium so your buds can pack on weight and taste GREAT!! Potassium is a particularly important MACRO nutrient because it helps the plant regulate the opening and closing of the stomata, and therefore regulates C02 uptake. Every good grower knows how important C02 is for indoor plants because if the plants don’t get enough your yields will REALLY suffer. Potassium also plays a major role in the regulation of water through plant roots and really is considered the “quality” nutrient.</p>

									<div class="content">
										<h2 class="major">VEG OUT</h2>
										<p>VEG OUT is for the vegetative part of your grow. It provides the plant with Nitrogen, Calcium and Magnesium. Nitrogen is the most important MACRO nutrient the plant needs early in life as it is important for helping the plants grow big, strong, and healthy.  Calcium and Magnesium are also MACRO nutrients and are especially important for healthy plant growth. Calcium helps with the formation of cell walls and Magnesium acts as a Phosphorus carrier and is essential for Phosphate metabolism. This product will help keep your plants healthy, strong, and lush.</p>

									<div class="content">
										<h2 class="major">GROW BIG OR GO HOME</h2>
										<p>GROW BIG OR GO HOME is a Nitrogen heavy fertilizer that will help your plants pack on size and structure in the vegetative part of your grow. Plants need a lot of Nitrogen in the early parts of their life to grow big and strong before the flowering process can begin.</p>
										<p>Plants that are starved for Nitrogen early in life can never produce big yields because the plants will be too weak to produce or sustain BIG, HEAVY BUDS!! GROW BIG OR GO HOME is a MUST use product for any grower that is serious about getting the most out of their plants every grow.</p>

									<div class="content">
										<h2 class="major">PROSPEROUS PHOSPHORUS</h2>
										<p>PROSPEROUS PHOSPHORUS is Phosphorus and Potassium heavy fertilizer for the flowering part of your grow. Phosphorus is a key MACRO nutrient the plant needs throughout its life but is especially important when the plant flowers because it allows your plants to perform photosynthesis converting light into energy and directly affecting yield. PROSPEROUS PHOSPHORUS gives your plants the right amount of Phosphorus and Potassium to ensure your plants can maximize their potential every time.</p>

										<h2 class="major">ROCKET FUEL</h2>
										<p>ROCKET FUEL is heavy Nitrogen fertilizer for the vegetative part of your grow that help your plants put on mass before the flowering process can begin. It consists of 2 different Nitrogen sources Calcium Nitrate and Potassium Nitrate. Many people make the mistake of focusing too much on feeding the plant during the flowering faze and not enough on building the plant big and strong before flowering process so it can support BIG, HEAVY YIELDS!! Give your plants the best start in life so they can pay you back in massive buds.</p>
